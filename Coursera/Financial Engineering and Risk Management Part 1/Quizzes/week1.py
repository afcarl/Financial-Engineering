Q1. Lottery payments
    A major lottery advertises that it pays the winner $10 million. However this prize money is paid at the rate of
    $500,000 each year (with the first payment being immediate) for a total of 20 payments. What is the present value of
    this prize at 10% interest compounded annually?
    Report your answer in $millions, rounded to two decimal places. So, for example, if you compute the answer to
    be 5.7124 million dollars then you should submit an answer of 5.71.

Q2. Sunk Costs (Exercise 2.6 in Luenberger)
    A young couple has made a deposit of the first month's rent (equal to $1,000) on a 6-month apartment lease. The
    deposit is refundable at the end of six months if they stay until the end of the lease. The next day they find a
    different apartment that they like just as well, but its monthly rent is only $900. And they would again have to put a
    deposit of $900 refundable at the end of 6 months.
    They plan to be in the apartment only 6 months. Should they switch to the new apartment? Assume an (admittedly
    unrealistic!) interest rate of 12% per month compounded monthly.

Q3. Relation between spot and discount rates
    Suppose the spot rates for 1 and 2 years are s1=6.3% and s2=6.9% with annual compounding. Recall that in this course
    interest rates are always quoted on an annual basis unless otherwise specified. What is the discount rate d(0,2)?
    Please submit your answer rounded to three decimal places. So, for example, if your answer is 0:4567 then you should
    submit an answer of 0:457.
